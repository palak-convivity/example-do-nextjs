RPC service example cloudflare...

we created a service in backend app 
and then connect it in the wrangler file of frontend 

//RPC worker to worker 

we can use function of one worker to another worker by using an entrypoint in worker one

github example
https://github.com/megaconfidence/workers-rpc-example


but just adding simple service in wrangler file

services = [
  { binding = "WORKER_ONE", service = "worker-one" }
]

(binding) is the name of the service we want to use from another worker
(service) is the name of the project or the name we use in wrangler file
